// The differences
// Think of an elevator
// Linked lists                                          Arrays
// Do not have indexes                              Indexed in order
// Connected via nodes with a next pointer          Insertion, deletion can be very expensive
// Random access is not allowed                     Can quickly be accessed at a specific index.
// Linked lists - a data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
// Linked lists contains of nodes, each node has a value and a pointer to another node.
